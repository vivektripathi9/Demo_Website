# How to Open the Website

Since Node.js is not installed on your system, I've created a **standalone version** that works without a server!

## Option 1: Open Directly in Browser (Easiest)

1. Navigate to the `public` folder in File Explorer
2. Double-click on `index.html`
3. The website will open in your default browser!

**That's it!** The website will work completely - all products, shopping cart, and features are functional.

## Option 2: Install Node.js (For Full Server Experience)

If you want to run the server version:

1. **Download Node.js** from: https://nodejs.org/
   - Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version
   - Run the installer and follow the instructions
   - Restart your terminal/command prompt after installation

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open in browser:**
   - Go to: http://localhost:3000

## Current Status

✅ **Standalone version is ready!** Just open `public/index.html` in your browser.

The standalone version includes:
- All 12 men's clothing products
- Shopping cart functionality
- Category filtering
- Responsive design
- All features working perfectly

Enjoy your ecommerce website! 🛍️
